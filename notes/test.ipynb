      "| **Scientific/Existential** | Life has no pre‑written purpose; we create one by choosing goals, relationships, and values. | Each decision feels like a chance to write a new chapter. |\n",
      "| **Religious / Spiritual** | Often tied to a higher power, moral code, or cosmic order. | Knowing a bigger plan can bring comfort and guidance. |\n",
      "| **Humanist / Secular Ethics** | Meaning comes from improving ourselves and others, cultivating empathy, and contributing to humanity. | Seeing progress in your community can be incredibly fulfilling. |\n",
      "| **Narrative / Personal Story** | Your story is built from moments of growth, struggle, and connection. | Reflecting on your journey can reveal unexpected purpose. |\n",
      "| **Stoic / Impermanence** | Focus on what you control, accept what you can’t. Meaning is living virtuously in the present. | Staying present can reduce anxiety and increase joy. |\n",

      "2. **Spot your impact**: How does that passion touch others or the world?  \n",
      "3. **Set a tiny goal**: Pick one small, concrete action you can do today that aligns with that passion and impact.  \n",

      "Doing that each day gradually builds a life that feels meaningful, even if the ultimate “big why” remains a personal mystery. Whatever you find, remember that the journey itself often carries its own purpose. 🚀\n"
